## Sample code from the Leap SDK book

These are small projects written in C++ and JavaScript to demonstrate capabilities of the 
Leap Motion Controller and proper structuring of programs making use of gesture input. 
These are fully functional sample programs from the book 
[Leap Motion Development Essentials](http://www.packtpub.com/leap-motion-development-essentials/book).

All OS-specific code is written for Mac OS X. Windows and Linux versions would be much appreciated.

* Chapter 1: A very basic program to dump out finger position, and a program to control your mouse.
* Chapter 2: Demonstration of using pthreads and custom gesture recognizers. Functional MIDI controller.
* Chapter 3: A program to let you move and resize windows with gestures.
* Chapter 4: Simple web page that draws finger positions using the leapjs library.
* Chapter 5: Basics of 3d interaction with the leap, a web page with a cube you can rotate with your hand.
